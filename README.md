# DiceGame
A simple demonstration of basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

How to Use:

Simply place ten markers on the numbers shown (2-12).  After placing desired markers, press 'Roll Dice' button to simulate the
rolling of two dice.  When the numbers shown on the dice add up to one of the numbers on the board, the program will check if
there are any markers on the number and increment a roll counter.  If there are markers, the program will remove one from the 
number.  The game will continue until no markers are left on the board.
